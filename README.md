Test-data:

#How it works:
 - Pinata storage available and working
 - Blockchain wallet with admin access funded

Universities' role:
 - University registers through official email [list of verified emails needed]
 - Upload all previous data in bulk (One-time upon sign up)
 - Every year, as new batch graduates, records are added
 - Every data upload produces TxID which is supposed to be saved and shared with students

Students' role:
 - Share TxID with employer when applying (add to your Resume)

Employer's role:
 - Use student details + TxID provided by applicant to verify details
